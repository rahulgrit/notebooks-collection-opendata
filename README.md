# Analysing the ATLAS open datasets
The binder contains a collection of simple python notebooks to analyse the ATLAS Open Data datasets.

## Instructions to get set-up:
In order to access the code, you first must make a GitHub account. If you already have one, skip ahead to step number 4. 
 1. Go to: <https://github.com>,
 2. Fill in the registration form; it's free and you'll only need a valid email address to join.
 3. Once you've validated your account, ensure you're logged in.
 4. Fork this repository by clicking on:

    near the top right hand corner. This creates your own personal copy of the master branch for you to edit and run. 

### To launch the binder:
Click on the link below titled "launch binder" to access the code.
 - Note if it's the first time running, it may take up to 15 minutes to load and build the environment.

## Editing the code:
Individual files can be edited either through GitHub, or once you've launched the binder.
For example on GitHub, the main page of your fork should something like this:

If you click on the folder titled `13-TeV-examples`, then `python`, and then select file `ATLAS_OpenData_13-TeV_python_full_HyyAnalysis_5min.ipynb`, you can then edit this file by clicking the edit ![](https://github.com/amcdouga/Screenshots/blob/master/Screen%20Shot%202020-05-28%20at%206.11.34%20pm.png) button. 

### Optional:
Rather than using the GitHub browser/Binder to read and edit code, you might want to have a copy of your local machine. This way you can edit the code locally (useful if you have an unstable internet connection for example), push your changes to your fork, and then return to this page to load the binder and run the code. (Note you won't be able to run the code locally unless you have ROOT installed).
